# File name changer/reformater for data files.

- Uses native modules:

  - `re` : regex
  - `sys` : system
  - `os` : os
  - `calendar` : calendar

- For this example to work the filename is expected to be in the form `data-DD-MMM-YY.txt`

- To run provide it with a path to the data directory, else it will assume that you are running the file in a folder that contains a `data` dir.
